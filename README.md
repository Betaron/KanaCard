## Description
This application is designed for learning and practicing Japanese alphabets: Hiragana and Katakana.
The essence of the application is that the user determines a deck of cards, shuffles them, and pulls them out one by one while checking the pronunciation of this kana. The application is aimed at being used at every opportunity: at home, on the road, before bed or after waking up.

## Features
When developing the application, the goal was to get a product as similar as possible to the native one for modern Android. The application implements such features as:
- Application language depending on the region (En, Ru)
- MaterialU view
- Animations
- Adaptive theme
- Monochrome icon
- Loading animation
- Saving state

and much more...
